            Omkareshwar is a Hindu temple dedicated to God Shiva. It is one of the 12 revered
            Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is on an island called Mandhata or Shivapuri in the Narmada river at
            Khandwa district in Madhya Pradesh, India; the shape of the island is said to be like the Devanagari ॐ
            symbol.

            There are two main temples of Lord Shiva here, one to Omkareshwar (whose name means "Lord of Omkara or the
            Lord of the Om sound") located in the island and one to Mamleshwar (whose name means "Immortal Lord" or
            "lord of the Immortals or Devas") located on the south bank of Narmada River on the mainland.

        <p id="mahakalp">Shri Mahakaleshwar of Ujjayini is known among the twelve celebrated Jyotirlingas in India. The
            glory of
            Mahakaleshwar temple has been vividly described in various Purans. Starting with Kalidasa, many sanskrit
            poets have eulogized this temple in emotive terms. Ujjain used to be the central point for calculation of
            Indian time and Mahakala was considered as the distinctive presiding deity of Ujjain.The presiding deity of
            time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternal in Ujjain. The temple of Mahakaleshwar, its shikhara
            soaring into the skies, an imposing façade against the skyline, evokes primordial awe and reverence with its
            majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of
            modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link with past traditions. One of the 12 Jyotirlingas in
            India, the lingam at the Mahakal is believed to be swayambhu (born of itself), deriving currents of power
            (Shakti) from within itself as against the other images and lingams which are ritually established and
            invested with mantra-shakti. The idol of Mahakaleshwar is known to be dakshinamurti, facing the South. This
            is a unique feature, upheld by tantric tradition to be found only in Mahakaleshwar among the 12 jyotirlingas
